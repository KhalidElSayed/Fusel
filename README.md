Fusel is a little, free game on the AppStore.

Collect fusels (Fusel is the Luxembourgish way of writing lint) to earn points. You have to look very closely because they are tricky and hard to recognize.

Find the game on the AppStore and try it out:

I hope this code helps you to get deeper into iOS coding.
