Fusel
=====

Fusel is a little, free game on the AppStore.

> Have you ever checked your pullover for lint out of boredom? This lint, also called fuzz, appear out of nowhere and is everywhere.
> In this App, it's all about this mysterious fuzz. Collect it to earn points. You have to look very closely because they are tricky and hard to recognize.
> Compare your points to your friends' points and become the master of the fuzz hunters! 
> By the way: Fusel is the Luxembourgish way of writing lint.
